     * Class for describing a Tree serialization (i.e. : a mapping between
     * the joints of the tree and 0 .. nrOfJoints-1 and 0 .. nrOfSegments-1)  
     * Please note that the joints "names" are actually the name of the segments
     * relative to the joint, so (in URDF terms) the relative link name.
     * 
     * Assuming (as currently in KDL) that joints can have only 0 (fixed) or 1 dof.
     * 
     * A serialization can be considered valid also if the id of an segment
     * is not always lower then the id of any of its children 
     * 
     * \todo : in solver inizialization, getLinkName is used for all the links
     *         should be the case to replace the vector with a more efficient (in query)
     *          data structure?
